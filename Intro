DWSIM comes with six default compound
databases (DWSIM, ChemSep, Biodiesel, CoolProp, ChEDL and Electrolytes), with a total of more than 1500 compounds available for your simulation.

Property package: Consists of methods and models to calculate physical and chemical properties of a compound.
If you have any new value (parameters)- you can configure in the model.

Calculations: Phase equilibrium, Numerical methods, Fail-safe procedure
Numerical method: Nexted loops, Inside-out, Gibbs minimization

Property package selection modules: Most thermodynamic models have binary interaction parameters which are fitted to match experimental data.
DWSIM has a tool to regress experimental data and calculate binary interaction parameters for various thermodynamic models.

Non polar gases at low pressure (<10 atm): Raoults law
Non polar gases at high pressure (>10 atm): PR, SRK, PRSV2
Polar gases at high pressure (>10 atm):PRSV2
Systems with high hydrogen content: Chao-Seader, Grayson-streed, LKP
Air separation/Refrigeration system: Coolprop package

DWSIM Chemical reactions

Conversion reaction--function of temperature
Equilibrium reaction--characterised by equilibrium constant; Equilibrium and gibbs
Kinetic/Heterogeneous/Catalytic reaction-- led by a velocity expression 
which is a function of concentration of reagents and /or products and / or a catalyst.; PFR, CSTR;
Heterogeneous Catalytic reactions must obey the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, where
compounds react over a solid catalyst surface. In this model, reaction rates are a function of catalyst
amount (i.e. mol/kg cat.s). These reactions are supported by the PFR and CSTR reactors.

Reaction extent: Equilibrium compostion is found according to the reaction information in the reaction set.



Dynamic modeling and simulation

While steady-state analysis is mainly used for process flowsheet design, usually to determine mass and
energy balances and approximate equipment sizes, or perhaps stream properties, the ability of dynamic
models to model transient behavior opens up a whole new world of application.

Technicals
Phase equilibrium: the component fugacities are same in all phases.


Fugacity Coefficient calculation models

Peng-Robinson Equation of State The Peng-Robinson equation Peng and Robinson 1976 is an cubic
Equation of State (characteristic related to the exponent of the molar volume) which relates temperature,
pressure and molar volume of a pure component or a mixture of components at equilibrium.


The cubic equations are, in fact, the simplest equations capable of representing the behavior of liquid and vapor
phases simultaneously. The Peng-Robinson EOS is written in the following form

Soave-Redlich-Kwong Equation of State  and PR :  low temperature and pressure conditions, can provide three roots for
Z. In this case, if liquid properties are being calculated, the smallest root is used. If the phase is vapor,
the largest root is used. 

Calculation models for the liquid phase activity coefficient

The activity coefficient γ is a factor used in thermodynamics to account for deviations from ideal be-
haviour in a mixture of chemical substances.
