DWSIM comes with six default compound
databases (DWSIM, ChemSep, Biodiesel, CoolProp, ChEDL and Electrolytes), with a total of more than 1500 compounds available for your simulation.

Property package: Consists of methods and models to calculate physical and chemical properties of a compound.
If you have any new value (parameters)- you can configure in the model.

Calculations: Phase equilibrium, Numerical methods, Fail-safe procedure
Numerical method: Nexted loops, Inside-out, Gibbs minimization

Property package selection modules: Most thermodynamic models have binary interaction parameters which are fitted to match experimental data.
DWSIM has a tool to regress experimental data and calculate binary interaction parameters for various thermodynamic models.

Non polar gases at low pressure (<10 atm): Raoults law
Non polar gases at high pressure (>10 atm): PR, SRK, PRSV2
Polar gases at high pressure (>10 atm):PRSV2
Systems with high hydrogen content: Chao-Seader, Grayson-streed, LKP
Air separation/Refrigeration system: Coolprop package
Steam/water simulations: Steam table property package
Polar chemicals: NRTL, UNIQUAC, UNIFAC

DWSIM Chemical reactions

Conversion reaction--function of temperature
Equilibrium reaction--characterised by equilibrium constant
Kinetic/Heterogeneous/Catalytic reaction-- led by a velocity expression which is a function of concentration of reagents and /or products and / or a catalyst.

Characterization of petroleum fractions

Characterization from bulk properties
Characterization from distillation curves
Bulk/Batch creation of pseudocomponents/pseudocompounds 


Compound creator

Enables usage of experimental data as well as UNIFAC structure information to calculate and/or estimate all constant and temperature-dependent properties for a com-
pound that isnâ€™t available on any of the default databases

UNIFAC (Universal Functional group Activity Coefficients)
UNIQUAC (Universal QUasi-chemical)


Data regression utility supports regression of experimental binary data for determination of international parameters (PC-SAFT, PR, SRK, UNIQUAC, NRTL)

Following data are supported: Txy, Pxy, TPxy, Txx, Pxx, TPxx,
