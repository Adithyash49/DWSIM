DWSIM Chemical reactions

Conversion reaction--function of temperature
Equilibrium reaction--characterised by equilibrium constant; Equilibrium and gibbs
Kinetic/Heterogeneous/Catalytic reaction-- led by a velocity expression 
which is a function of concentration of reagents and /or products and / or a catalyst.; PFR, CSTR;
Heterogeneous Catalytic reactions must obey the Langmuir‚ÄìHinshelwood mechanism, where
compounds react over a solid catalyst surface. In this model, reaction rates are a function of catalyst
amount (i.e. mol/kg cat.s). These reactions are supported by the PFR and CSTR reactors.

Dynamic modeling and simulation

While steady-state analysis is mainly used for process flowsheet design, usually to determine mass and
energy balances and approximate equipment sizes, or perhaps stream properties, the ability of dynamic
models to model transient behavior opens up a whole new world of application.

Technicals
Phase equilibrium: the component fugacities are same in all phases.


Fugacity Coefficient calculation models

Peng-Robinson Equation of State The Peng-Robinson equation Peng and Robinson 1976 is an cubic
Equation of State (characteristic related to the exponent of the molar volume) which relates temperature,
pressure and molar volume of a pure component or a mixture of components at equilibrium.


The cubic equations are, in fact, the simplest equations capable of representing the behavior of liquid and vapor
phases simultaneously. The Peng-Robinson EOS is written in the following form

Soave-Redlich-Kwong Equation of State  and PR :  low temperature and pressure conditions, can provide three roots for
Z. In this case, if liquid properties are being calculated, the smallest root is used. If the phase is vapor,
the largest root is used. 

Calculation models for the liquid phase activity coefficient

The activity coefficient Œ≥ is a factor used in thermodynamics to account for deviations from ideal be-
haviour in a mixture of chemical substances.

AI/ML-Based Models (Active Research Area)
Researchers are now training AI models to predict rate constants (ùëò) and activation energies using:

Molecular descriptors (from SMILES, InChI)
Graph neural networks (GNNs) or deep learning models
Thermodynamic correlations from databases like NIST, Reaxys, PubChem
These models are beginning to bypass full quantum calculations, making them much faster.

Examples: Open Reaction Database (ORD)
IBM RXN for Chemistry
DeepChem
Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs AutoQSAR

PID controller: control loop feedback device that continuously calculates an error value as the difference between
a desired setpoint and a measured process variable.

The controlled variable (what you want to maintain)
The manipulated variable (what you adjust to control it)
The monitored/measured variable (sensor output, i.e., the process variable)

Pressure control

CV: Pressure
Common sensors: Bourdon tube, strain gauge
MV: Valve opening(inlet/outlet gas or liquid), compressor speed

Temp control

CV: Temperature

Measured variable: Thermocouple, RTD, thermistor

Flow rate control

CV: Flow rate
Measured variable: Flow rate (via flowmeter)
Flow sensors: Orifice plate, venturimeter, coriolis flowmeter, Ultrasonic/Doppler
Manipulated variable: Control valve position, pump speed

Volume / level control

CV: Liquid volume or level in tank
Measured variable: level or height
Common level sensors: Float based, ultrasonic, radar
Manipulated variable: Inflow or outflow rate (valves/pumps)


Control system

Dead time (œÑ_d): (also known as time delay or transport delay) is the amount of time that elapses between 
the moment an input or disturbance is applied to a system and the moment its effect first becomes observable in the system output.

Delay time:  is the time required for the system‚Äôs output to reach 50% of its final value following a step change in input.

Definition of Process Gain (K‚Çö):
The process gain is the ratio of the steady-state change in the output (controlled variable) to the change in the input (manipulated variable), 
following a step change.

ùêæ_ùëù = ŒîCV/ŒîMV

Time constant: The time constant is simply a measure of how quickly the system responds to that change

Identifying a control system

1.) Select the model
2.) Parameter extimation
3.) Model validation (Tangent method, statistical method)
