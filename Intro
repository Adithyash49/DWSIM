DWSIM comes with six default compound
databases (DWSIM, ChemSep, Biodiesel, CoolProp, ChEDL and Electrolytes), with a total of more than 1500 compounds available for your simulation.

Property package: Consists of methods and models to calculate physical and chemical properties of a compound.
If you have any new value (parameters)- you can configure in the model.

Calculations: Phase equilibrium, Numerical methods, Fail-safe procedure
Numerical method: Nexted loops, Inside-out, Gibbs minimization

Property package selection modules: Most thermodynamic models have binary interaction parameters which are fitted to match experimental data.
DWSIM has a tool to regress experimental data and calculate binary interaction parameters for various thermodynamic models.
